### A React.js & Material UI based Blog system

#### Jan 09 2018 - Seattle
It has been almost two years since I started this project from day 1 during my senior year of high school. Instead of majoring anything technical, I chose to major in Business and haven't been coding. It was such a lovely night tonight, so I started to work on this again. The structure is done and stable now, but it is still a WIP(work in progress). I need to finish the admin panel and some minor UI details. The system is still not so beginner friendly so I will add useful scripts later. Hopefully, I can wrap things up in the next few weeks. 

刚开这个项目的时候还是高三的时候，如今已经两年了。大学之后我选择主修商学于是很久没有写过代码。今天晚上迷之心血来潮重启了这个项目。如今大概构架已经重构完成了。还需要完成Admin Panel的部分和很多细节。之后我会加一些对beginner友好的script。希望接下来几周我有空继续工作在这个上面。

#### Not work perfectly on mobile devices (especially those with small screen). Trying to fix that right now.

#### Feature
This is a single page application completely built using React.js & React Router. My personal [blog](http://blog.ziorix.com) is hosted by Github Pages. All the `.md` files(as post content) is also loading using Ajax from Github. For detailed info, go to my [blog](http://blog.ziorix.com) and check out the `How did I creat a blog System` series. 

### UPDATE NOTE JAN 09 2018 - Seattle
The system is no longer static. I added a lightweight Node.js + MongoDB server.


## Contact Me if you feel interested, because setting up the repo and making it run is not easy right now. As I said, I will add setup scripts by the end of my development.
